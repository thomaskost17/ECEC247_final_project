# ECEC247_final_project
RNN for EEG signal processing

# Environment Standards
This project is set up using the conda envrionment package manager. To recreate the envrionment the following commands can be run. First we must create the conda environment:

```
conda create --name EEG_RNN python=3.9
```
The required packages can then be installed via the following command:

```
conda activate EEG_RNN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
At this point you should have a functional python environment identical to the one used in the development of this project. Note, any alternative methods of installing the environment are also acceptable as the `requirements.txt` file is included.
